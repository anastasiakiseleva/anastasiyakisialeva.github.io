# Anastasiya Kisialeva - Technical Writer

## About myself

I've been working the field of technical communication since 2009 writing about various software solutions for end-users and developers.  

I'm passionate about making documentation accessible, informative, and easy to read. My main focus is on streamlining and improving user scenarios, developing tutorials and how-to guides, writing code samples and API guides.  

I believe in the team effort and synergy between developers and technical writers that is necessary to give users practical knowledge they can immediately apply.  

In my free time I read a lot and study frontend development at JetBrains Academy. You can find my beginner projects on my GitHub page: [case converter](https://github.com/anastasiakiseleva/case-converter) and [flashcards](https://github.com/anastasiakiseleva/Flashcards).
